Git Workflow:  

1. Fork the repo
Make some changes.  
later can merge changes back to the original project.

2. Made a copy on our local computer (copy/paste the repo)  - using clone with https

created code102 under my user folder.
ls -la  shows all hidden directors .git is a hidden directory
git status from command line tells you the status of a directory if it is a git repo.


Questions:  
?? vim (edit from command line?)
?? touch ( creates a file?) .

JS tutorial:
?? How can I experiment with my own JS code?  

/*variables and substring*/
var myName = "Monica"
var myNickName = myName.substring(0,2)
consol.log(myName, myNickName)  /*prints out myName and myNickName values*/

/*comparisons and if/then syntax*/
var myName = "Monica";
if (myName.length === 5)
console.log("not right");
else console.log("I finished my first course");
